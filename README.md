# News Site

Replace this readme with your own information about the project. You can include things like:

- This assigment was to make a new site with grid and flex-box. 

## Approach
- Started with browsing for inspiration about common elements and layouts
- Drew a layout on paper first, marking up the different boxes with colors to get a netter overview of it. 
- Cloned the project and used Visual Studios to code in. 
- When stuck on properties or what to do i googled to find solutions, like making a search bar.
- Made a rough html with placeholder texts for paragraphs and headers. Also added empty img tags. 
- Chose pictures for the logo and the three line menu, and added to the code
- Started with CSS after the rough html was done

- If you had more time, what would be next?
