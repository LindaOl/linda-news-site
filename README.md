# News Site
- This assigment was to make a new site to practice grid and flex-box. 

## Approach
- Started with browsing for inspiration about common elements and layouts on news site
- Drew a layout on paper, marking up the different boxes with colors to get a better overview
- Cloned the project and used Visual Studios to code in. 
- When stuck on what or how to do I googled to find solutions, like making a search bar.
- Made a rough html with placeholder texts for paragraphs and headers. Also added empty img tags. 
- Added images and text
- Added some colors
- Started with the CSS file for desktop to get an idea of how i wanted it to end up
- Then restarted the CSS, going from mobile first, to tablet and lastly desktop
- I wanted to use flexbox quite a bit to learn it better.
- Tried out @keyframes for some animations.
- Had some sizing issues with my search bar, that became very small on high resolution screens

## If you had more time, what would be next?
- work to better the code
- make everything even more grid based
- make the row with articles of different sized columns better
- work on the animated banner that isn't really like I wanted it to be.
